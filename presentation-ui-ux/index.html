            <h3>Doing research about this topic/subject</h3>
            <p>First i started with doing research on this subject to get to know the topic. I was reading more 
                about Japanese traditional gardens, after i read about them, i started visiting sites about gardeners and read something more about them
                because i had to combine those two topics. After having a solid knowleage i went to the next step.<br> <br>

                <p>In this phase i was doing a research about the target audience. The questions that i asked myself the most were </p>

                <br />
                <p>Creating personas varies between 3-8, it depends on how many you need. I created 3 personas:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>One for a traveler looking for informations.</li>
                    <li>One for a research needs.</li>

                    The goal was to try to accomplish was a minimalistic look, and the 8 minutes sketches gave me way more ideas that i wouldn't consider if i didn't try

                <h3>Finding which color to use</h3>
                <p> Green is a cool color that symbolizes nature and the natural world. Perhaps because of its strong associations with nature, green is often thought to represent tranquility, good luck, health, and jealousy.
                Researchers have also found that green can improve reading ability. Some students may find that laying a transparent sheet of green paper over reading material increases reading speed and comprehension.
                Green has long been a symbol of fertility and was once the preferred color choice for wedding gowns in the 15th-century. Even today, green M&M's (an American chocolate candy) are said to send a sexual message.
                Green is often used in decorating for its calming effect. For example, guests waiting to appear on television programs often wait in a “green room” to relax.</p>

            <p>What i learned from doing this project is that the designing comes last, before doing this project i always started with the designing solutions and ideas first, 
            and now i learned that it's much easier when we go step by step, doing the research, targeting out audience, getting to know our users.<br />
            All of these steps helped me a lot, and all of the reading and exploring that i did for this project gained me much more knowleage.
            I used to not give much attention to the UX part, i was not doing the researches that deep and i didn't knew how important it is to know your users,
            and when i did the research i discovered so many articles which reading them made me realize how much little things can change the user experience and make it better.<br />
            After this project i can say that i definitely learned new things, discovered intresting articles, I started paying more attention to the user experience, and after doing all that 
            research about the topic, i felt more organized and prepared than when i didn't used to do much research.
