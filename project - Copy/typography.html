        <p>Let’s delve a little deeper into why typography is so important.</p>

        <h3 id="fontlink">Fonts and Typefaces</h3>
        <p>There’s some confusion surrounding the difference between typefaces and fonts, with many treating the two as synonymous.<span id="bold"> A typeface is a design style which comprises a myriad of characters of varying sizes and weight, whereas a font is a graphical representation of text character. </span>Put simply, a typeface is a family of related fonts, while fonts refer to the weights, widths, and styles that constitute a typeface.</p>
        <p><span id="bold">There are three basic kinds of typeface: serif, sans-serif, and decorative.</span> To keep the interface uncluttered and streamlined, a good designer will never use more than three fonts—and keep decorative fonts to a minimum. </p>

    <section class="ccw">
        <article class="contrast">
        <h3 id="contrastlink">Contrast</h3>
        <p><span id="bold">Much like hierarchy, contrast helps to convey which ideas or message you want to emphasize to your readers. </span>Spending some time on contrast makes your text interesting, meaningful, and attention-grabbing. .</p>
    </article>
    <article class="consistency">
        <h3 id="consistency1">Consistency</h3>
        <p><span id="bold">Keeping your typefaces consistent is key to avoiding a confusing and messy interface. </span>When conveying information, it’s essential to <span id="bold">stick to the same font style</span>, so your readers instantly understand what they’re reading, and begin to notice a pattern. .</p>
    </article>
    <article class="white-space">
        <h3 id="white-space1">White Space</h3>
        <p>Often referred to as ‘negative space,’ <span id="bold">white space is the space around text or graphics.</span> It’s often overlooked and tends to go unnoticed by the user, but <span id="bold"> proper use of white space ensures the interface is uncluttered and the text is readable. </span></p>

    <article class="colorp">
        <h3 id="color1">Color</h3>
        <p>Color is one of the most exciting elements of typography. This is where designers can really get creative and elevate the interface to a new level. Text color, however, is not to be taken lightly:<span id="bold"> nailing your font color can make the text stand out and convey the tone of the message —but getting it wrong can result in a messy interface and text that clashes with the site colors.</span>
           
           <br/><span id="bold"> Color has three key components: value, hue, and saturation.</span> A good designer will know how to balance these three components to make the text both eye-catching and clearly legible, even for those with visual impairments.</p>

            <h3 id="alignment1">Alignment</h3>
            <p><span id="bold">Alignment is the process of unifying and composing text, graphics, and images to ensure there is equal space, size, and distances between each element.</span> Many UI designers create margins to ensure that their logo, header, and body of the text are aligned with each other. <span id="bold">When aligning your user interface, it’s good practice to pay attention to industry standards.</span> For example, aligning your text to the right will seem counterintuitive for readers who read left to right.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="hierarchy">
            <h3 id="hierarchy1">Hierarchy</h3>
            <p>Establishing hierarchy is one of the most vital principles of typography.<span id="bold"> Typographical hierarchy aims to create a clear distinction between prominent pieces of copy that should be noticed and read first, and standard text copy.</span> In an age of short attention spans brought about by social media, designers are urged to be concise and create typefaces that allow users to consume the necessary information in short amounts of time.</p>
